# VSC Settings
This is a template content of the user VSC folder.

## Installation
In MacOS this should be placed at `/Users/<user name>/Library/Application Support/Code/User`. A good idea is to
 use a symlink there to the repo.

## Keyboard bindings

### MacOS
These bindings use some MacOS default system-wide key shortcuts. To use them it is adviced to disable or change theme.

To do this go to System Settings -> Keyboard.

The list:
- F11 - Mission Control -> Show desktop
